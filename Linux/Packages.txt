Ubuntu uses APT (Advanced Package Tool) as its main package manager. This is how Ubuntu installs, updates, and removes software safely from trusted repositories.

🧰 1. What Is a Package Manager?

    A package manager is a system tool that:
        • Installs software and all its dependencies
        • Updates installed software
        • Removes software cleanly
        • Manages repositories (software sources)

    On Ubuntu, the package manager is APT, which works with .deb packages.

⚙️ 2. Basic APT Commands

    Let’s go step-by-step with examples.
    All of these commands are run in the terminal (press Ctrl + Alt + T to open it).

    🔹 Update the package list
        sudo apt update
        This refreshes the list of available packages from repositories.
        (Do this before installing or upgrading anything.)

    🔹 Upgrade installed software
        sudo apt upgrade
        This updates all your installed packages to the latest versions available.

        If you want to also remove old packages that are no longer needed:
            sudo apt full-upgrade

    🔹 Install software
        sudo apt install <package-name>
        Example:
            sudo apt install git
        That installs Git from Ubuntu’s official repositories.

    🔹 Remove software
        sudo apt remove <package-name>
        Example:
            sudo apt remove firefox

        To remove it and its configuration files:
            sudo apt purge <package-name>

    🔹 Clean up unused files
        After removing packages or upgrading, clean up leftover files:
            sudo apt autoremove
            sudo apt clean

📦 3. Searching for Packages

    If you’re not sure of a package name:
        apt search <keyword>
        Example:
            apt search python3

    Or check detailed info about a package:
        apt show <package-name>

🧩 4. Installing from .deb Files

    Sometimes you’ll download a .deb file (like Chrome or VS Code).
    You can install it manually using:
        sudo apt install ./filename.deb

    or
        sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
        sudo apt -f install   # fix missing dependencies

🌐 5. Adding Extra Repositories (Optional)

    If you want software not in the default Ubuntu repos, you can add a PPA (Personal Package Archive):

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:<user>/<repo>
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install <package-name>

    Example:
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install nvidia-driver-550
