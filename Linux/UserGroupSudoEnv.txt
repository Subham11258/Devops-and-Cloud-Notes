🧑‍💻 1. Users

    In Linux, every person or process that interacts with the system is a user.

    🔹 Key Concepts

        Root user:      The superuser with full control over the system (can do anything).
        Normal users:   Have limited permissions, typically used for daily tasks.
        System users:   Created by the OS for services (like www-data for Apache, mysql for databases, etc.)

    🔹 Important Files

        /etc/passwd:    Contains user account information.
        /etc/shadow:    Contains encrypted passwords and password rules.

    🔹 Common Commands

        whoami              # Shows your username
        id                  # Shows your UID and group info
        adduser alice       # Adds a new user named 'alice'
        passwd alice        # Sets or changes password for user 'alice'
        deluser alice       # Deletes a user

👥 2. Groups

    A group is a collection of users — used to manage permissions efficiently.

    🔹 Purpose

        Instead of giving permissions to each user individually, you assign them to a group, and then manage access by group.

    🔹 Important Files

        /etc/group:         Contains group information.
        /etc/gshadow:       Contains secure group details.

    🔹 Common Commands

        groups alice                # Shows which groups 'alice' belongs to
        addgroup developers         # Creates a new group
        usermod -aG developers alice# Adds 'alice' to the 'developers' group
        delgroup developers         # Deletes the group

🔑 3. sudo (Superuser Do)

    sudo allows a regular user to execute administrative commands as another user — usually root.

    🔹 Why It’s Important

        You shouldn’t log in as root all the time because it’s unsafe.
        sudo gives you temporary, controlled access to admin privileges.

    🔹 Common Commands

        sudo apt update              # Run package update as root
        sudo su                      # Switch to root user
        sudo -u postgres psql        # Run a command as another user (here, 'postgres')
        visudo                       # Safely edit the sudoers configuration

    🔹 Configuration File

        /etc/sudoers: Controls who can run what with sudo.

        Example entry:
            alice ALL=(ALL) ALL
            → User alice can run any command as any user on any host.

🌎 4. Environment Variables

    Environment variables store configuration and system-wide information that programs and the shell can use.

    🔹 Examples

        PATH    — directories where executables are searched.
        HOME    — user’s home directory.
        USER    — current username.
        SHELL   — default shell (e.g., /bin/bash).
        PWD     — current working directory.

    🔹 Commands

        printenv            # Show all environment variables
        echo $PATH          # Show value of PATH variable
        export VAR=value    # Set a variable for the current shell session
        unset VAR           # Remove a variable

    🔹 Persistent Environment Variables

        Temporary: set with export VAR=value — lasts until you close the terminal.

        Permanent: add to:
            ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile   → for a single user.
            /etc/environment or /etc/profile → system-wide.

        Example:
            export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
            export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
