Let’s go through Process Management and Background Jobs in Linux in detail.
This is a key concept for system administration, shell scripting, and performance monitoring.

🧩 1. What is a Process in Linux?

    A process is simply an instance of a running program.
    Every time you execute a command or open an application, Linux creates a process with a unique PID (Process ID).

⚙️ 2. Process Management Commands

    🧾 a) ps – Process Status

        The ps command shows information about active processes.

        Common usages:

            Command         Description
            ps              Shows processes of the current shell.
            ps -e or ps -A  Shows all processes on the system.
            ps -f           Full-format listing (UID, PID, PPID, CMD, etc.).
            ps aux          Shows all processes by all users in BSD style.
            ps -ef          Shows all processes in full-format (System V style).

        Example:

            ps -ef | grep firefox
            → Lists all Firefox-related processes.

    📊 b) top – Real-time Process Viewer

        The top command displays a dynamic view of system processes (CPU, memory usage, uptime, etc.).

        Usage:

            top

        Once open:
            P   → Sort by CPU usage
            M   → Sort by Memory usage
            k   → Kill a process by PID
            q   → Quit

        Alternative tools:
            htop (interactive, colorized version)
            atop, glances (more detailed system monitors)

    ☠️ c) kill – Terminate a Process

        Used to stop a process using its PID.

        Syntax:

            kill <PID>

        Signals:

            Signal  Name      Description
            1       SIGHUP    Hang up (reload config)
            9       SIGKILL   Forcefully kill (cannot be trapped)
            15      SIGTERM   Terminate (default)

        Examples:

            kill 2345              # Gracefully terminate
            kill -9 2345           # Force kill
            killall firefox        # Kill all processes named 'firefox'

    ⚖️ d) nice and renice – Adjust Process Priority

        Linux uses “niceness” to determine the scheduling priority of processes.

        Niceness range: -20 (highest priority) to +19 (lowest)
        Default niceness: 0

        Start a process with a specific niceness:
            nice -n 10 myscript.sh
            → Runs the script with lower priority.

        Change niceness of an existing process:
            renice -n -5 -p 1234
            → Increases priority of process 1234 (requires root privileges for negative values).

🧵 3. Background and Foreground Jobs

    Linux shells allow multitasking — you can run processes in the foreground or background.

    ▶️ Foreground Job

        When you run a command normally:
            ping google.com
        It runs in the foreground and blocks the terminal until you stop it (Ctrl+C).

    ⏸️ Background Job

        To run a process in the background, add an ampersand (&):
            ping google.com &
        Now, the shell immediately returns control to you.

    📋 Managing Jobs

        Key Commands:

            Command      Description
            jobs         Lists current jobs with their IDs.
            fg %1        Brings job 1 to the foreground.
            bg %1        Resumes a stopped job in the background.
            kill %1      Kills job number 1.

        Example session:

            sleep 100 &
            jobs           # [1] 1234
            fg %1          # Brings sleep job to foreground
            Ctrl+Z         # Suspends it
            bg %1          # Runs it again in background

    🛠️ Job States

        Running    – process executing normally
        Stopped    – suspended with Ctrl+Z
        Terminated – process finished or killed

🧱 Detaching and Disowning Jobs

    If you close the terminal, background jobs will stop unless detached.

    To prevent that:

        nohup long_task.sh &
        disown

    nohup (“no hangup”) makes process ignore the hangup signal.
    disown removes it from the shell’s job table (it won’t die if you log out).

🧠 4. Summary Table

    Command      Purpose                           Example
    ps           View processes                    ps aux
    top          Monitor live processes            top
    kill         Terminate by PID                  kill -9 2345
    nice         Start process with niceness       nice -n 10 script.sh
    renice       Change priority                   renice -n -5 -p 1234
    jobs         Show job list                     jobs
    bg / fg      Move job to background/foreground bg %1
    nohup        Detach job from terminal          nohup python
